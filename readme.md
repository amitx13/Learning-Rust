# NOTES:
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
Four important details to notice here.
    First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.
    Second, println! calls a `Rust macro`.! means that youâ€™re calling a macro instead of a normal function and that macros donâ€™t always follow the same rules as functions.
    Third, you see the "Hello, world!" string.
    Fourth, we end the line with a `semicolon` (;)

Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed. If you give someone a .rb, .py, or .js file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation installed (respectively). But in those languages, you only need one command to compile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.

Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager
We can create a project using `cargo new`.
We can build a project using `cargo build`.
We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations

Input/Output
The `io` library comes from the standard library, known as `std:`
`use std::io;`

use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
The let mut guess = String::new(); line has created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a String. Whew!
like variables, references are immutable by default. Hence, you need to write `&mut guess` rather than `&guess` to make it mutable.

The purpose of these `Result` types is to encode `error-handling` information.
Resultâ€™s variants are `Ok` and `Err`. The `Ok` variant indicates the operation was successful, and inside Ok is the successfully generated value. The `Err` variant means the operation failed, and Err contains information about how or why the operation failed.

`{}` in println!() is a `placeholder` for a value

Using a `Crate` to Get More Functionality
Remember that a `crate` is a collection of Rust source code files. The project weâ€™ve been building is a `binary crate`, which is an `executable`. The rand crate is a `library crate`, which contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and `canâ€™t be executed on its own`.


# Systems language:
    It is intended to be used (but not restricted to) to do lower level things
    Building a Compiler
    Building a browser
    Working closer to the OS/kernel

# Generally faster:
    Rust has a separate compilation step (similar to C++) that spits out an optimised binary and does a lot of static analysis at compile time. 
    JS does JIT(Just-in-time) compilation. rust code => binary => run

# concurrency - running multiple threads on a single machine
Rust has built-in support for concurrent programming allowing multiple threads to perform tasks simultaneously without risking data races

note: node js is single threaded but can be used as a multithreaded by using IPC - inter process communication

# Memory Safe:
    Rust has a concept of owners,borrowing and lifetimes that make it extremely memory safe 

# Initializing rust project:
    cargo init (application)
    cargo init --lib (library-This would initialize a library that you can deploy for other people to use)


# Use Case:
Rust projects can be used to do a lot of things
    Create Backend for a Full stack app
    Create CLIs (command line interfaces)
    Create browsers
    Great Code Editors

In case of overflow Rust uses the term `panicking` when a program exits with an `error`

# Scalar Types:
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: `integers`, `floating-point` numbers, `Booleans`, and `characters`. You may recognize these from other programming languages

# Compound Types:
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: `tuples` and `arrays`.

# Variables:
Binding and mutability
ðŸŒŸ A variable can be used only if it has been initialized. Uninitialized variable caused error
ðŸŒŸ Use mut to mark a variable as mutable.
    assert_eq!(x, 5); can be used to check equality

Constants arenâ€™t just immutable by defaultâ€”theyâ€™re `always immutable`. You declare constants using the `const`    

Shadowing generally used to convert a value from one type to another type.
when shadowing let must be used otherwise it will throw an error when shadowing one variable type and value can be changes into another type and value but in mut a variable can only change it's value not the type
You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable and can also reinitialize it 
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    {
        let x = 12; //Shadowing  here we can say the first one is shadowed by the second one.
        assert_eq!(x, 12);
    }

    assert_eq!(x, 5);

    let x = 42;
    println!("{}", x); // Prints "42".
}

Destructuring
// Fix the error below with least amount of modification
fn main() {
    let (mut x, y) = (1, 2);
    x += 2;

    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}

Destructuring assignments
You can now use tuple, slice, and struct patterns as the left-hand side of an assignment.

fn main() {
    let (x, y);
    (x,..) = (3, 4); Tuple Assignment
    [.., y] = [1, 2]; Array Pattern Matching
    // Fill the blank to make the code work
    assert_eq!([x,y], [3, 2]);

    println!("Success!");
} 

# Number: i8 , i16 , i32(By Default) , i64 , i128

doesn't , matter if the value is correct or not the type should also be similar 
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 1;
    let y: f32 = 32.8;
    println!("{}", x);
}

error (
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let mut y: u32 = 5;

    y = x;
    
    let z = 10; // Type of z ? 
    println!("Success!");
}
)

casting a u8 value to u16 value 
fn main() {
    let v: u16 = 38_u8 as u16;

    println!("Success!");
}

# Floating-Point
By default f64 assigns

# Booleans:
fn main() {
    let is_male = false;
    let is_above_18 = true;
    
    if is_male {
        println!("You are a male");

    } else {
        println!("You are not a male");
    }

    if is_male && is_above_18 {
        print!("You are a legal male");
    }
}

# String:
    let str1:&str = "apx13";
    print!("str => {}\n",str1);
    
    let str2 = String::from("apx13_");
    print!("str2 => {}\n",str2);

        In Rust, &str and String are both used to represent strings, but they have different ownership and memory management characteristics:

        &str: This is a string slice, which is a reference to a string stored elsewhere. It's a borrowed reference, meaning it doesn't own the data it refers to. It's commonly used for string literals like "apx13" in your example.
        String: This is a growable, mutable, owned string type provided by the standard library. It owns the string data it contains, allowing for dynamic manipulation such as appending, removing, or modifying characters.

# The Tuple Type:
A tuple is a general way of `grouping` together a number of values with a `variety of types` into one compound type. Tuples have a `fixed length`: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses

eg. `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
destructure    `let (x, y, z) = tup;`
We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. For example:
    
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;

# The Array Type:

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the `same type`. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a `fixed length`.

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the `stack` rather than the `heap`
A `vector` is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to `grow` or `shrink` in size.

let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let a = [3; 5]; // = [3,3,3,3,3]

# Statements and Expressions:
Statements are instructions that perform `some action and do not return a value.`
statement example:
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}

`Function` definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a statement in itself.

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you canâ€™t assign a `let` statement to another variable, as the following code tries to do; youâ€™ll get an `error`:
Error: `let x = (let y = 6);`
In other language you can write `x = y = 6` and have both x and y have the value `6`; that is `not the case in Rust.`

Expressions `evaluate to a resultant value.`
Consider a math operation, such as `5 + 6`, which is an expression that evaluates to the value `11`.
`Calling a function` is an expression. `Calling a macro` is an expression. A new `scope block` created with `curly brackets` is an expression
Example

fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five(); // Here the 5 is got returned becz it's an `expression` and expression returns a value. Note there is not a return type and also semicolon 
                    // (not statement) still is got returned that's the beauty of expression 
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}


Keep in mind:
Note that the `x + 1` line doesnâ€™t have a `semicolon` at the end, which is unlike most of the lines youâ€™ve seen so far. `Expressions do not include ending semicolons`. If you add a `semicolon` to the end of an `expression`, you turn it into a `statement`, and it will then not return a value.

# Conditions:
pub fn main() {
    let x = 99;
    let is_even = is_even(x);
    if is_even {
        print!("{} is even", x);
    } else {
        print!("{} is odd", x);
    }
}

pub fn is_even(x: i32) -> bool {
    return x % 2 == 0;
}

Note:pub is short for "public", and it's used to specify the visibility of items such as functions, structs, enums, and other declarations.

let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 }; can also be used in assigning variable but the point here is it should be of same type 
like if condition { 5 } else { "six } will throw an error

# Loops:

loop{
    //works as infinite loop so break statement is necessary
}

fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() { //.rev() to reverse the range:
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}

pub fn main() {
    let str = String::from("harkirat singh");
    println!("First name {}", get_first_name(str))
    
}

pub fn get_first_name(str: String) -> String {
    let mut first_name = String::from("");
    for c in str.chars() {
        if c == ' ' {
            break
        }
        first_name.push(c);
    }
    return first_name;
}

fn _ in 0..10{
    println!("hi");
}

# Function:
fn do_sum(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
	return a + b;
}

Note:In Rust, the main function serves as the entry point for executable programs,

# Memory management:
# Garbage collector
1. Written by smart people
2. Usually no danging
pointers/memory issuse
3. You cant do manual
memory management
4. Examples - Java, IS

# Manual:
1. You allocate and
deallocate memory yourself
2. Can lead to danging
pointers/memory issuse
3. Learning curve is high
since you have to do manual
MM
Examples - c

# The rust way:
1. Rust has its own
ownership model for memory
management
2. Makes it extremely safe
to memory errors

# Memory Management in Rust:
Rust has it's own ownership model for memory management which makes it's extremely safe to memory errors
Not having a garbage collector is one of the key concept why rust is so fast 

memory management is primarily handled through ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, which together ensure memory safety without needing a garbage collector. This approach is known as "ownership system" and it's one of the key features of Rust.

Ownership: Every value in Rust has a variable that's its owner. There can only be one owner at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (or deallocated).
Borrowing: Instead of transferring ownership, Rust allows you to borrow references to values. Borrowing can be either immutable or mutable. Multiple immutable borrows can exist simultaneously, but only one mutable borrow can exist at a time, and it excludes any other borrows, whether mutable or immutable.
Lifetimes: Lifetimes ensure that references are valid for as long as they are needed and no longer. They prevent dangling references, which occur when a reference refers to memory that has been deallocated.

1. Mutability
2. Heap and Memory 
3. Ownership model 
4. Borrowing and references
5. Lifetimes

# Mutability
By default all the variables are immutable 
mmutable data is inherently `thread-safe` because if no thread can alter the data, then no `synchronization` is needed when data is accessed concurrently.And no `race around` condition 
Knowing that certain data will not change allows the compiler to optimize code better. 

# Heap and Memory 
When something is stored in the heap their is still a ptr ( length ,capacity , pointer ) that is stored in the stack . which points the value in the heap

(ownership)
two things cannot points to the same data in heap from stack (Rihana example)
Rihana only dies when owner dies she will not die when borower dies 

cloning is expansive for heap 

(Borowing means - kind of passing referense)
borowing can be done in two ways 
1. `mutable referenses`
2. `ImMutable referenses`
like rihana can have multiple borower but in case of multiple borower she cannot do hanky panky (`ImMutable referenses`) with anyone but if she still wants to do hanky-panky with borower she is only allowed to have only one borower(`mutable referenses`)
note: if owner goes out of scope all the borower will die and if borower goes out of acope it doesn't effect the owner

# mutable referenses
only one mutable referense is allowed
if there is a mutable referense then immutable referense is not allowed (in case u are using the mutable referense but if u are not using the mutable referense then the immutable referense can exists) 

# Rules of Borrowing that makes it memory safe
multiple immutable referenses is allowed
single mutable referenses are allowed at a time (hanky panky)
if their is a mutable referense then their cannot be another immutable referenses either

This to avoid any data races/inconsistent behaviour
If someone makes an immutable reference , they donâ€™t expect the value to change suddenly
If more than one mutable references happen, there is a possibility of a data race and synchronization issues


# Rust by Practice:
`Ownership and Borowing`

fn main() {
    // Use as many approaches as you can to make it work
    let x = String::from("Hello world");
    let y = x.clone();
    println!("{}, {}",x, y);
}

Approach - .clone() that will create an another instance of x and point it to y

// Don't modify code in main!
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Hello world");
    let s2 = take_ownership(s1);

    println!("{}", s2);
}

// Only modify the code below!
fn take_ownership(s: String) -> String {
    println!("{}", s);
    return s;
}

1.Approach returned the borrowed value 2.Retrun through expression
